  <!-- COMBAK: Academic Experience Paragraph -->
  <h3>Academic Experience</h3>
  <p>I sucks at everthing, fat boy, such a slow learner and a iconic lastbench student. Everytime gets average marks in my school days and I had some inferiority complex throughout my school days,
    I don't know, Which maybe due to my appereance. Then I joined a blood sucking money minded college. Due to my low marks, I able to join here only. But, when compared to school days, My college life is far better.
    <br>If you ask me like <em>"Did you learn anything from your life? and Where?"</em> I would strongly say it's from my college experience. It's the only place where I become <strong> a self learner</strong>.
